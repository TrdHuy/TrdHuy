## Welcome

👋 Hi. I am Huy. I am a seasoned fullstack engineer with a passion for software development 🧑‍💻. I specialize in server applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications. With years of experience, I've worked on a variety of projects that span across multiple platforms and technologies.

🚀 I have had the privilege of working at [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/), where I spent several years researching and developing innovative software solutions. My time at Samsung has honed my skills in creating robust and efficient software systems, and I bring that expertise to every project I work on.

📈 Throughout my career, I have managed and led the development of multiple software projects, ensuring they are delivered on time and meet high-quality standards. As a software architect, I have designed and implemented scalable and maintainable software architectures that drive business success.

⚡️ I am obsessed with creating robust and efficient software solutions. I enjoy solving complex problems and building scalable systems that enhance user experiences. 

🎓 Additionally, I serve as an internal lecturer at Samsung, where I teach Android application programming. Through this role, I have the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with colleagues, helping to cultivate the next generation of skilled developers within the company.
